What is IAAS?
	Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers essential compute, storage, and networking resources on demand, 	on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Characteristics of IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service):
	IAAS is like renting virtual computers and storage space in the cloud.
	You have control over the operating systems, applications, and development frameworks.
	Scaling resources up or down is easy based on your needs.

Example of IAAS (Infrastructure As A Service):
Amazon Web Services
Microsoft Azure
Google Compute Engine
Digital Ocean

What is PAAS?
	Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything 	from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications.

Characteristics of PAAS (Platform as a Service):
	PAAS is like a toolkit for developers to build and deploy applications without worrying about infrastructure.
	Provides pre-built tools, libraries, and development environments.
	Developers focus on building and managing applications, while the provider handles infrastructure management.
	It speeds up the development process and allows for easy collaboration among developers.

*Diff between Statefull and Stateless
      -	Stateful applications retain data between sessions, but stateless applications don't. For example, stateful applications remember products in a 	user's cart after logging out, while stateless applications treat every login as a new session and cart information is lost.

*Statefull sets:	Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a
			Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the
			same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any
			rescheduling.

1.umask 022 sets the default permission for newly created files to 644 and
  for directories to 755.

-wget and curl are command-line tools used for downloading files from remote
 servers.
-Curl: Protocols Supported: HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, SCP, IMAP, LDAP/LDAPS
-wget: HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, and FTPS.
-grep: used for searching and manipulating text patterns within files
	-c: This prints only a count of the lines that match a pattern
	–i: Ignores, case for matching
	-l: Displays list of a filenames only.
Example: grep -i "UNix" geekfile.txt
	 grep -l "unix" * : Display the File Names that Matches the Pattern Using grep
	 grep -o "unix" geekfile.txt: Displaying only the matched pattern Using grep
- awk: awk is a versatile tool for text processing and reporting. It can also handle pattern
       matching and manipulation.
Example: Suppose you have a file named data.txt with the following content:
John 25
Alice 30
Bob 28
Eve 22

You can use awk to print only the names of people who are older than 25:
awk '$2 > 25 { print $1 }' data.txt

Output:
Alice
Bob

-Pipe: Piping commands involves sending the output of one command as the input to another command. This is achieved using the | (pipe) operator.

Example 1: List files and directories, and then filter for specific files using grep: ls -l | grep ".txt"

In this example, the ls -l command lists files and directories in long format, and the output is
piped to grep to filter and display only the lines containing ".txt".

Example 2: Count the number of lines in a file using wc:
cat file.txt | wc -l
Here, cat reads the content of the file, and its output is piped to wc -l, which counts the number
of lines.

------------------------------------------------------------Docker------------------------------------------------------------

5.What is Docker Multi Stage build:

Docker multi-stage build is a feature that allows you to have more than one FROM statement, each representing a stage in your Dockerfile. Each stage starts with a fresh image that can be used to perform specific tasks. With multi-stage Dockerfiles, you can also share data between build stages. This way, you can build the application in one stage and copy only the necessary components that the application needs to run to the final image, resulting in smaller and more optimized Docker images. 

# First stage - Building the application
# Use node:16-a;pine image as a parent image
FROM node:16-alpine AS build

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json files to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the source files
COPY . .

# Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# Second stage - Serve the application
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy build files to Nginx
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

The Dockerfile now has two stages or steps (characterized by the FROM statements). This will create a two-stage build process: the first stage builds the React application, and the second stage will serve the built application using Nginx. The COPY command in the second stage copies the contents of the build directory from the first stage (alias "build") into the Nginx web server default directory. This sets up Nginx to serve your React application.

*Diff between ENTRYPOINT and CDM
        ENTRYPOINT is the process that's executed inside the container. CMD is the default set of arguments that are supplied to the ENTRYPOINT process.

*What is Docker Compose, and why would you use it?
	Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container
	Docker applications. It simplifies the process of defining and
	orchestrating containers.

*Why are Docker volumes used?
	Docker volumes provide persistent storage for containers, allowing
	data to persist even if the container is stopped or removed.

*Explain the difference between a bind mount and a Docker volume.
	A bind mount links a directory on the host with a directory in the
	container, while a Docker volume is a managed storage solution
	created and maintained by Docker

*How can you improve Docker container security?
	Regularly update Docker and its components, use official images,
	minimize the number of running processes, and apply the principle of
	least privilege.

*What is the purpose of Docker Content Trust?
	Docker Content Trust ensures the integrity and authenticity of images
	by signing them using digital signatures.

*What is a Docker Registry?
	A Docker Registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker
	images. Docker Hub is a popular public registry

* docker logs <container_id> - Used to check logs.

*Explain the concept of blue-green deployment with Docker.
	Blue-green deployment involves deploying a new version of an application alongside the existing one and 
	switching traffic once the new version is deemed stable.

	- Used to ensure High Availability of Container
	- Create the replicas of container
	- Auto-Scaling/Load Balancing is possible

*Terminoligies
	- pods			--> Atomic unit of schedule in kubernetes
	- kubectl		--> command line utility to interact with Kubernetes Master Node
	- kubeadm 		--> command line utility to install and config the Kubernetes cluster
	- cluster		--> Logical Collection of worknodes.

*Deployment Controller Object		
			- It is used to deploy the pods 
			- It create Replicaset
			- It used to upgrade 
			- Roll-Back the changes 
			- Scale up 
			- Scale Down 

*Rolling Update: Here upgrade can be done without any downtime.
		 Rolling updates incrementally replace your resource's Pods with new ones, which are then scheduled on nodes with available resources. 			 Rolling updates are designed to update your workloads without downtime

*Replica Sets:   A Replica Set's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time.In replicasets there is a lot of properties 		 which helps replicasets to work properly. There is selector properties which helps replicasets to recreate the pods based on label when pod 		 failure happen, also helped to group the same label pods.
		 There is one more properties called template that help RS to create pod according to the given pod template.
		 Replicas properties is used to provide the number of desired pods to create.

*Kubernetes Services 
		- Nodeport 		: NodePort service in Kubernetes is a service that is used to expose the application to the internet from where the 					  end-users can access it. If you create a NodePort Service Kubernetes will assign the port within the range of 					  (30000-32767). The application can be accessed by end-users using the node’s IP address. 
		- ClusterIp 		: used to internal communication between the pods.
		- Load balancer		: The LoadBalancer Service provides load-balancing abilities for incoming traffic to distribute evenly across 						  multiple pods for better performance and high availability.

*Ingress: 	An API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster. typically it works on http request.Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS 		routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. 

*Daemenset		
	It is used to deploy a copy of pod in all the available Workernodes.

*Deployment
	A Deployment ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any
	given time. It can also be used to roll out updates to applications.

----------------------------------------------------------------TERRAFORM-----------------------------------


12. How to Automate 3 tier structure using Terraform

answer in this link - https://sheriffexcel.hashnode.dev/3-tier-architecture-on-aws-using-terraform

Terraform Commands: 
			terraform init - 	initializes the current directory
			terraform refresh - 	refreshes the state file
			terraform output - 	views Terraform outputs
			terraform apply - 	applies the Terraform code and builds stuff
			terraform destroy - 	destroys what has been built by Terraform
			terraform graph - 	creates a DOT-formatted graph
			terraform plan - 	a dry run to see what Terraform will do

Explain the difference between Terraform and other configuration management tools like Ansible or Chef.
Answer: While Ansible, Chef, and similar tools focus on configuration management and automating software deployment, Terraform is specifically designed for 	infrastructure provisioning and management. Terraform is best suited for creating and managing cloud resources, virtual machines, networks, etc., 	while configuration management tools are more focused on configuring and maintaining software applications.

What are the main components of a Terraform configuration?
Answer: The main components of a Terraform configuration are:

	Providers: 	They define the cloud or infrastructure platform where resources will be created.
	Resources: 	They define the infrastructure components you want to manage (e.g., virtual machines, networks).
	Data Sources: 	They fetch information from external sources (e.g., existing infrastructure) to use within the configuration.
	Variables: 	They allow you to parameterize your configuration.
	Outputs: 	They define values that are useful to display or pass to other parts of the configuration.

Provider: A provider is a plugin in Terraform that enables interaction with a specific infrastructure platform or cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google 	  Cloud). Providers handle the API calls and resource management for the platform.

How can you manage multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with Terraform?
Answer: Terraform provides "workspaces" to manage multiple environments. Each workspace allows you to maintain separate state files for each environment 	while using the same configuration files. You can switch between workspaces using the "terraform workspace select" command. This enables you to 	apply changes independently to different environments without interfering with one another.

What is Terraform's "null_resource," and how can it be useful?
Answer: The "null_resource" in Terraform is a resource type that allows you to define a provisioner without creating an actual infrastructure resource. It's 	useful for performing arbitrary actions on the local machine or remotely, such as running scripts or commands after creating other resources.

What do you mean by State File Locking?
	State file locking is a Terraform technique that prohibits multiple users from doing actions on the same state file at the same time. Once one 	user’s lock on a state file is released, any other user who has a lock on it can act on it.This helps to prevent state file corruption. A backend 	operation is gaining a lock on a state file in the backend. If getting a lock on the state file takes longer than intended, a status message will be 	produced.

Does Terraform allow you to roll back the changes you make?
		No, Terraform does not allow you to roll back the changes once they are made. However, the previous state of the infrastructure can be 			attained by reverting it to a previous state file. It is always important to maintain backups or different versions of the state file so 		rollbacks may be facilitated if needed.

Give the terraform configuration for creating a single EC2 instance on AWS.

	provider "aws" {
  		region = "us-west-2"   # Replace with your desired region
	}
	resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  	ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  	instance_type = "t2.micro"
	}

How does Terraform handle the drift detection of infrastructure state, and what actions can it take?
	Terraform detects infrastructure drift by comparing the current state with the expected state described in configuration files. It offers commands 	like “terraform plan” to identify changes and “terraform apply” to reconcile and bring the actual state in line with the desired state

Which value of the TF_LOG variable provides the most verbose logging?
	The most verbose logging level in Terraform is TRACE. This level will log all Terraform messages, including debug messages and provider plugin 	messages. To set the logging level to TRACE, use the following command:

	TF_LOG=TRACE terraform plan

	The other logging levels, in order of increasing verbosity, are DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR.


------------------------------------------------------Ansible--------------------------------------------------------

How does Ansible work?
	Ansible is a combination of multiple pieces working together to become an automation tool. Mainly these are modules, playbooks, and plugins.
	-Modules are small codes that will get executed. There are multiple inbuilt modules that serve as a starting point for building tasks.
	-Playbooks contain plays which further is a group of tasks. This is the place to define the workflow or the steps needed to complete a process
	-Plugins are special kinds of modules that run on the main control machine for logging purposes. There are other types of plugins also.


What are the features of Ansible?
It has the following features:

	Agentless – 		Unlike puppet or chef there is no software or agent managing the nodes.
	Python – 		Built on top of python which is very easy to learn and write scripts and one of the robust programming languages.
	SSH – 			Passwordless network authentication which makes it more secure and easy to set up.
	Push architecture – 	The core concept is to push multiple small codes to the configure and run the action on client nodes.
	Setup – 		This is very easy to set up with a very low learning curve and any open source so that anyone can get hands-on.
	Manage Inventory – 	Machines’ addresses are stored in a simple text format and we can add different sources of truth to pull the list using 				plugins such as Openstack, Rackspace, etc

What is Ansible Galaxy?
	Galaxy is a repository of Ansible roles that can be shared among users and can be directly dropped into playbooks for execution. It is also used for 	the distribution of packages containing roles, plugins, and modules also known as collection. The ansible-galaxy-collection command implements 	similar to init, build, install, etc like an ansible-galaxy command

How to setup a jump host to access servers having no direct access?
	First, we need to set a ProxyCommand in ansible_ssh_common_args inventory variable, since any arguments specified in this variable are added to the 	sftp/scp/ssh command line when connecting to the relevant host(s). For example

[gatewayed]
staging1 ansible_host=10.0.2.1
staging2 ansible_host=10.0.2.2

To create a jump host for these we need to add a command in ansible_ssh_common_args

ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -q user@gateway.example.com"'
In this way whenever we will try to connect to any host in the gatewayed group ansible will append these arguments to the command line

What is Ansible Vault?
	Ansible vault is used to keep sensitive data such as passwords instead of placing it as plaintext in playbooks or roles. Any structured data file or 	any single value inside the YAML file can be encrypted by Ansible. 

	To encrypt a file: 		ansible-vault encrypt foo.yml bar.yml baz.yml
	And similarly to decrypt: 	ansible-vault decrypt foo.yml bar.yml baz.yml

13. What is VNet

VNet stands for Virtual Network and is a fundamental building block to the private network in the cloud. It is a network or an environment that can be used to run virtual machines and applications in the cloud. When virtual machines and applications are created, they can communicate with one another securely.

14.What are fault domains?

A fault domain is a group of virtual machines that share a common power source and also network. Virtual machines in fault domains allow cloud providers to minimize hardware failures, power outages and also network disruptions. These fault domains are automatically distributed by the Azure platform

15.What is the update domains feature and its benefits?

Update domains are part of the Azure infrastructure and are responsible for managing and isolating hardware and software updates. When multiple virtual machines are designed, these update domains get automatically distributed using available sets. They can be rebooted or taken down for maintenance at the same time.

16.What is the Dogpile effect and how can it be prevented?

The Dogpile effect is the period after the cache expires and requests have been made on the website from the client. These subsequent requests lead to heavy or slow operations, such as database queries, which can lead to an excessive load on the database or overall service. The Dogpile effect typically happens in high-traffic websites and applications, in which a high increase in workload leads to a decrease in performance or downtime.

17.Can you state the difference between Azure DevOps services and Azure DevOps servers?

Azure DevOps services is a cloud-based service allowing organizations to make use of the Azure DevOps capabilities and features without the extra workload of setting up and maintaining their server infrastructure. The service is accessible from anywhere, goes through continuous updates, and is highly scalable.
Azure DevOps server is on-premise and is on an SQL server backend, where organizations can host on their own servers. It has been specifically designed for organizations that prefer their data within their network due to compliance or other regulatory reasons.

18.What is Azure Redis Cache?

Redis is an open source in-memory data store that can be used as a database, cache, or message broker. It's often used for caching web pages and reducing the load on servers.

19. Blue-Green Deployments
	• Description: Implementing blue-green deployments to switch between two identical environments to ensure zero downtime during updates.
	• Benefits: Ensures high availability, reduces risk during deployments, and allows easy rollback.
    Canary Releases
	• Description: Gradually rolling out new features to a small subset of users before full deployment using tools like Flagger or Argo Rollouts.
	• Benefits: Minimizes risk, provides real-world testing, and ensures smooth feature rollouts

20.Load Balancing
	• Description: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers using tools like NGINX, HAProxy, or AWS Elastic Load Balancing.
	• Benefits: Enhances reliability, improves performance, and ensures faulttolerance.

21.SonarQube: It is a tool to check code quality check(like bugs, vulnerabilities,syntax error) and code coverage(test the functionality of code like 80% code/test cases are covered then 80% code coverage is done.)
	*code coverage is dependent on test cases, so test cases execution happens before SonarQube.

------------------------------------------------------------Frequently Asked-------------------------------------------------------------


1.Can you explain the troubleshooting process for resolving issues in a Docker container?
	Firstly, I would check the container logs using the 'docker logs' command to gather information about any errors or issues. I would also check the 	Docker daemon logs to identify any underlying problems. Additionally, I would verify if the container is running properly by using the 'docker ps' 	command. If the container is not running, I would try restarting it with the 'docker restart' command. If the issue persists, I would inspect the 	container to gather more details on the running environment, network configuration, and processes using the 'docker inspect' command. I would also 	check the host system for any resource constraints that could be impacting the container's performance. If necessary, I might need to rebuild the 	container image or remove and recreate the problematic container. Finally, if none of these steps resolve the issue, I would consult relevant 	documentation or the Docker community to find a solution. Overall, the troubleshooting process requires a combination of log analysis, investigating 	container configuration, and understanding Docker best practices.

2.Describe your approach to troubleshooting issues with Ansible playbooks and roles.
	 First, I would review the playbook syntax and YAML structure for any syntax errors, indentation issues, or missing fields. I would also verify if 	the inventory file is correctly defined and reachable. Next, I would use the Ansible '--syntax-check' option to validate the playbook's syntax. If 	there are issues related to specific tasks or roles, I would enable verbose mode using 'ansible-playbook' with the '-vvv' flag to gather more 	detailed output. This helps in identifying any error messages, failed tasks, or misconfigured variables. Additionally, I would inspect the Ansible 	debug output for specific tasks to gather more information on variables and values. In case of skipped tasks, I would ensure that the conditions or 	tags for task execution are correctly defined. I would also check the target host's connectivity and SSH configuration, including SSH keys and sudo 	access. Collaborating with the development or infrastructure teams can also help in troubleshooting complex issues. If necessary, I would leverage 	Ansible's extensive logging capabilities to enable logging and review log files for any relevant errors or warnings. Documenting the troubleshooting 	steps and sharing them with the team contributes to a shared knowledge base and helps in avoiding similar issues in the future.

3.Can you explain the importance of infrastructure security in the DevOps workflow and how you ensure it?
	Infrastructure security is crucial in the DevOps workflow to protect applications, data, and resources from unauthorized access, vulnerabilities, and attacks. I ensure infrastructure security by implementing various measures. Firstly, I follow the principle of least privilege and implement strong access controls. I utilize IAM roles and policies to grant the minimum required permissions to users and resources. Secondly, I regularly update and patch software components, including operating systems, libraries, and applications, to mitigate known vulnerabilities. Thirdly, I implement network security measures, such as VPCs, security groups, and NACLs, to secure communication and isolate services. Lastly, I leverage security tools and services like AWS Inspector and AWS Security Hub to continuously monitor and assess the security posture of my infrastructure. By implementing these security measures, I can ensure a secure infrastructure environment and adherence to best practices and compliance standards.

4.How do you troubleshoot issues with Grafana dashboards and data sources?
	As a DevOps Engineer, troubleshooting issues with Grafana dashboards and data sources is a crucial task. I follow a systematic approach to identify and resolve such problems. Firstly, I would verify the connection between Grafana and the configured data sources, such as Prometheus or InfluxDB. I would ensure that the data sources' endpoints, credentials, and permissions are correctly defined in the Grafana configuration. If there are issues related to metric collection or display, I would review the dashboard panels' queries and check for any syntactical errors or misconfigured time ranges. Additionally, I would inspect the metrics' availability and correctness by directly querying the data sources, using tools like 'curl' or the data source's APIs. Collaborating with the development and infrastructure teams can help in troubleshooting complex issues related to metric instrumentation and collection. Furthermore, I would check the Grafana server logs for any errors, warnings, or performance bottlenecks. Understanding Grafana's templating features and variable scope can be beneficial to troubleshoot dynamic dashboards. If the issue persists, consulting the Grafana community or documentation for specific data source-related challenges or limitations can provide guidance. Documenting the troubleshooting steps, resolutions, and any modifications made to the dashboards or data sources is essential for maintaining a clear audit trail and ensuring accurate data visualization.

5.Can you describe the troubleshooting steps you would take when encountering issues in a Kubernetes cluster?
	As a DevOps Engineer with experience in Kubernetes, troubleshooting issues in a cluster requires a systematic approach. First, I would check the status of the cluster using the 'kubectl' command to ensure that all nodes and pods are running. If any pods are not in the expected state, I would investigate the logs from the respective pods using 'kubectl logs' to identify any errors or warning messages. Additionally, I would verify the resource allocation and usage in the cluster to identify if any pods or nodes are under heavy load, which could lead to performance issues. I would also check if all the dependent services and network configurations are properly defined and accessible within the cluster. If the issue is related to networking, I would inspect the network policies and rules within the cluster. Furthermore, I would review the cluster configuration, including the deployment files, labels, and annotations to ensure they are accurate. In some cases, scaling the cluster by adding more nodes might be a solution to handle increased load. If all else fails, I would consult the Kubernetes documentation, community forums, or seek assistance from colleagues with more expertise. It's essential to maintain clear communication with the development team and document the troubleshooting steps and their outcomes.
